# Python Prework — 3 Weeks of Practice 🐍💻

This repository contains **three weeks of Python prework** completed as part of my **Java Learn-to-Code Academy**. The exercises cover foundational Python concepts and build problem-solving skills to prepare for more advanced programming topics.

---

## 📝 Overview of Work Completed

Over the three weeks, I worked on:

1. **Advanced Conditional Logic** ⚡  
   - Multi-condition decisions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`  
   - Logical operators (`and`, `or`) and nested conditionals  
   - Example scenarios: 🎬 movie ratings, 💰 loan approval, 🌤 weather advisories, 🏦 banking security  

2. **Lists and Conditional Logic** 📋  
   - Creating, modifying, and indexing lists  
   - Checking membership and applying conditions to elements  
   - Stretch exercises included manual calculations without loops 🛠  

3. **Loops and While Loops** 🔁  
   - Iteration using `while` loops  
   - Performing calculations across list elements  
   - FizzBuzz and other loop-based challenges 🎯  
   - Stretch exercises involved filtering strings manually ✨

## 🌟 Key Skills Learned

- Writing complex conditional statements 🧠  
- Using lists to store and manipulate data 🗂  
- Implementing loops to automate repetitive tasks 🔄  
- Performing manual calculations for problem-solving ➕➖  
- Thinking logically to solve coding challenges without relying solely on built-in Python functions 🧩

## 💡 Notes

- This prework laid the groundwork for understanding programming logic before diving into Java 🏗  
- Stretch exercises helped strengthen problem-solving skills and attention to detail 💪  
- Each exercise emphasized planning: writing steps in English/pseudocode before implementing in Python 📝
